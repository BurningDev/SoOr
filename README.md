# SoOr
SoOr (SoftwareOrganizer) is a opensource platform, to organize your softwareprojects.

## About this project
This platform should help you, to manage your softwareproject form start to finish.

**This is how it should work:**

First, you create the members (of your organisation or business) and assign them to difficulty teams. Now you start to create a softwareproject step-by-step. First, you must add information about your project. In the next step, you create parts of your project (e.g.: analysis, modelling, implementation, testing ...) and assign them to a team. Optional, you can add a deadline for each part.
If you've finished your project and find bugs, you can use the integrated issuetracker.
